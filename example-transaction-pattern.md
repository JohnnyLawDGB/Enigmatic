# Example Transaction Pattern (Placeholder)

This file is for non-sensitive, synthetic examples of how an Enigmatic
transaction *could* be shaped.

You can later add hand-crafted sample transactions that mirror patterns you’ve
observed (e.g., specific value constants, fees, and input/output counts),
without exposing actual counterparties.
