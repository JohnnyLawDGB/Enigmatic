# 06 — Security Model (Skeleton)

This document will define the security and detectability properties of the
Enigmatic protocol.

## 6.1 Adversary Model

- Passive chain observer  
- Active reordering / censorship adversary  
- Economic adversary (fee manipulation, dust attacks)  

## 6.2 Security Goals

- Steganographic indistinguishability  
- Robust decoding for in-protocol participants  
- Resistance to trivial pattern detection
