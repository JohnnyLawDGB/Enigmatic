# Enigmatic — A Layer-0 Communication Protocol  
**DigiByte-Optimized Edition**

## 1. Introduction

Enigmatic is a Layer-0, chain-native communication protocol that encodes
structured messages into DigiByte transactions without requiring any change to
consensus rules.

Transactions remain valid and economically meaningful, but when interpreted
under the Enigmatic ruleset, they also form a **steganographic message stream**.


## 2. Background and Design Rationale

- DigiByte UTXO model  
- Value precision and dust thresholds  
- Block times, multi-algo mining, and entropy sources  


## 3. Formal Model

See [`../specs/03-formal-model.md`](../specs/03-formal-model.md).
